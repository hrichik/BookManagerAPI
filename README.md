# BookManagerAPI
A C#/.NET Application I made that uses REST APIs  and CRUD to manage book-keeping.
- Leveraged HttpClient to interact with a REST API, performing POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE operations.
- Implemented async/await to handle asynchronous HTTP requests for smooth, non-blocking execution.
- Serialized and deserialized JSON data using System.Text.Json to communicate with the API.
- Handled user input safely, including parsing integers for the year without crashing on invalid input.
- Used dynamic object creation for sending book data to the API in HTTP requests.
- Managed RESTful endpoints correctly, including adding resource IDs for update and delete operations.
- Implemented error handling for HTTP requests to catch exceptions and display meaningful messages
- Enhanced user experience with color-coded console output for different actions (add, update, delete, list).
- Built a menu-driven interface with a loop, allowing continuous interaction until the user exits.
